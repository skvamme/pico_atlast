STACKSTRINGS ( str1 str2 str3 strn -- ) 

This is the documentation for the previous block. (You need to copy/paste the contents of blockzero.atl
to the forth terminal in order to define the forth word STACKSTRINGS).

STACKSTRINGS takes everything on the stack and puts it in a string buffer, in reverse order.  In other words,
the last line in your text should be on top of the stack.

The string buffer can then be used as the source buffer for the forth word SAVEBUFFER.


Max string length is 130 and max number of strings on the stack is 100.

These values can easily be changed in atlast.c main function.


The buffer size is 4096 bytes. This corresponds to 50 lines of code if you keep line length to 80.

Blank lines counts as 1 byte.

Make sure the stack is empty before you put your strings on it.


If you have a text file that you want to put in a forth block, use the shell script atl2blk.sh

It converts your text file to a file where each line is a separate string.

Copy-paste the contents into your forth terminal or use the CU file transfer command.

Then use STACKSTRINGS to fill the string buffer and SAVEBUFFER to save the data.


Example

You have a file, blockone.txt that you want to load into block 1.

Run the shell script:

./atl2blk.sh blockone.txt

And in the forth terminal:

~ >
blk.atl

(or just copy paste the contents of blk.atl to the forth terminal)

STACKSTRINGS

1 EMPTYBUFFER

BUFFER 1 SAVEBUFFER

Now you can try:

1 0 LIST

to list the contents of block 1

This content will survive both poweroff and drag/drop a new uf2 file to the pico.
